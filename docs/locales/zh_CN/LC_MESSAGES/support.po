"The ``babel.support`` modules contains a number of classes and functions "
"that can help with integrating Babel, and internationalization in "
"general, into your application or framework. The code in this module is "
"not used by Babel itself, but instead is provided to address common "
"requirements of applications that should handle internationalization."

"One such requirement is lazy evaluation of translations. Many web-based "
"applications define some localizable message at the module level, or in "
"general at some level where the locale of the remote user is not yet "
"known. For such cases, web frameworks generally provide a \"lazy\" "
"variant of the ``gettext`` functions, which basically translates the "
"message not when the ``gettext`` function is invoked, but when the string"
" is accessed in some manner."

"Many web-based applications are composed of a variety of different "
"components (possibly using some kind of plugin system), and some of those"
" components may provide their own message catalogs that need to be "
"integrated into the larger system."

#: ../../support.rst:35
msgid ""
"To support this usage pattern, Babel provides a ``Translations`` class "
"that is derived from the ``GNUTranslations`` class in the ``gettext`` "
"module. This class adds a ``merge()`` method that takes another "
"``Translations`` instance, and merges the content of the latter into the "
"main catalog:"
