"While :ref:`message catalogs <messages>` allow you to localize any "
"messages in your application, there are a number of strings that are used"
" in many applications for which translations are readily available."

"Imagine for example you have a list of countries that users can choose "
"from, and you'd like to display the names of those countries in the "
"language the user prefers. Instead of translating all those country names"
" yourself in your application, you can make use of the translations "
"provided by the locale data included with Babel, which is based on the "
"`Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) <https://unicode.org/cldr/>`_ "
"developed and maintained by the `Unicode Consortium "
"<https://unicode.org/>`_."

"You normally access such locale data through the "
":class:`~babel.core.Locale` class provided by Babel:"

"In addition to country/territory names, the locale data also provides "
"access to names of languages, scripts, variants, time zones, and more. "
"Some of the data is closely related to number and date formatting."

"Most of the corresponding ``Locale`` properties return dictionaries, "
"where the key is a code such as the ISO country and language codes. "
"Consult the API documentation for references to the relevant "
"specifications."

msgid "Likely Subtags"
msgstr ""

#: ../../locale.rst:50
msgid ""
"When dealing with locales you can run into the situation where a locale "
"tag is not fully descriptive.  For instance people commonly refer to "
"``zh_TW`` but that identifier does not resolve to a locale that the CLDR "
"covers.  Babel's locale identifier parser in that case will attempt to "
"resolve the most likely subtag to end up with the intended locale:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../locale.rst:62
msgid ""
"This can also be used to find the most appropriate locale for a "
"territory. In that case the territory code needs to be prefixed with "
"``und`` (unknown language identifier):"

#: ../../locale.rst:73
msgid ""
"Babel currently cannot deal with fuzzy locales (a locale not fully backed"
" by data files) so we only accept locales that are fully backed by CLDR "
"data.  This will change in the future, but for the time being this "
"restriction is in place."

msgid ""
"Locales itself can be used to describe the locale itself or other "
"locales. This mainly means that given a locale object you can ask it for "
"its canonical display name, the name of the language and other things.  "
"Since the locales cross-reference each other you can ask for locale names"
" in any language supported by the CLDR:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../locale.rst:96

"Display names include all the information to uniquely identify a locale "
"(language, territory, script and variant) which is often not what you "

"The :class:`~babel.core.Locale` class provides access to many locale "
"display names related to calendar display, such as the names of weekdays "
"or months."

"These display names are of course used for date formatting, but can also "
"be used, for example, to show a list of months to the user in their "
"preferred language:"
